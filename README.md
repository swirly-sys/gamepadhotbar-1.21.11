Gamepad Hotbar is a client mod for Minecraft which makes the HUD hotbar more gamepad friendly by rearranging the slots and adding new control binds.

The slots are paired with each other, with the first 8 placed into adjacent quadrants on one side of the screen, and the 9th
and off-hand slots placed into their own pair on the other side of the screen.
They're arranged to resemble the directional-pad and face buttons of a standard game controller.

In each of the in-game menu screens, this mod adds distinct icons to each of the inventory hotbar slots to make it clear
where each gamepad hotbar slot corresponds.

Control binds
=
___
Five new control binds have been added for making hotbar slot selection more accessible on gamepads:
- `Cycle Hotbar Left` → cycles through the item pair in the left quadrant
- `Cycle Hotbar Up` → cycles through the item pair in the up quadrant
- `Cycle Hotbar Right` → cycles through the item pair in the right quadrant
- `Cycle Hotbar Down` → cycles through the item pair in the down quadrant
- `Cycle Weapon Slot` → selects the 9th hotbar slot (a.k.a. "weapon slot")

By default, these control binds are unmapped. The ideal way to assign them is to have the cycle hotbar
quadrants correspond to directions on your controller's d-pad and map the weapon button to something different,
such as a face button or shoulder button. Alternatively, hotbar quadrants could be mapped to the four face buttons,
and the weapon slot to a d-pad button.

Configurable 
=
___
A mod configuration screen is included where users can adjust the position of the hotbar on their display.
Multiple options are available to suit a variety of user tastes. This also serves to account for mods that alter the
positions of other HUD elements.
